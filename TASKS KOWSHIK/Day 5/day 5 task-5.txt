Cluster Analysis Report
1. Introduction
This report presents an analysis of the clusters obtained from the K-means clustering algorithm applied to the Iris dataset. The goal is to identify meaningful patterns in the clustered data.

2. Dataset Description
The Iris dataset consists of four numerical features:

Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width
These features were used to segment the dataset into K=3 clusters.

3. Cluster Summary
Cluster	Avg. Sepal Length	Avg. Sepal Width	Avg. Petal Length	Avg. Petal Width	Characteristics
0	5.0	3.4	1.5	0.2	Likely represents Iris-setosa, smaller petals and sepals.
1	6.5	3.0	5.5	2.0	Likely Iris-virginica, longer petal length and width.
2	5.8	2.7	4.1	1.3	Likely Iris-versicolor, intermediate characteristics.
4. Observations & Patterns
Cluster 0 contains points with small petal length and width, indicating one type of flower.
Cluster 1 has the largest petal and sepal measurements, suggesting another species.
Cluster 2 falls in between, with moderate values, suggesting a transition between the two groups.
5. Interpretation & Applications
This analysis helps in species classification without prior labels.
It can be extended to other biological datasets where species need to be differentiated.
Similar clustering techniques can be used in customer segmentation, medical diagnosis, and anomaly detection
